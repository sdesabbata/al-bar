# Al bar

Work in progress! :sweat_smile:

The aim is to conduct an analysis similar to the work presented by Chris Brunsdon, Paul Harris and Lex Comber at [GIRSRUK 2022](http://liverpool.gisruk.org/), in the paper [*"A Spatial Analysis of British Public House Names"*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6410180), but focusing on *Italian "cafes"*. However, for a number of cultural and historical reasons, *Italian "cafes"* can be understood and encoded in OpenStreetMap (the data source for this project) as: `amenity => cafe`, `amenity => bar`, `shop => bakery`, `shop => confectionery`, `shop => chocolate`, `amenity => ice_cream` or `shop => ice_cream`. This will definitely need to be discussed here at some point -- likely, this has already been discussed somewhere else.
